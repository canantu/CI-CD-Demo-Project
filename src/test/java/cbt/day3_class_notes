Q: Could there be any situation where test passes on our local browser, but fails on server??

A: yes, especially if remote server is linux-based and local is windows.

 - Screen resolution (scroll to element before interaction - JavaScriptExecuter Actions)
 - Synchronization (add more waits)
 - path to downloaded content (specify path in ChromeOptions/FirefoxOptions)

    Map<String, Object> prefs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    prefs.put("download.default_directory",  System.getProperty("user.dir")+ File.separator + "externalFiles" + File.separator + "downloadFiles");
    ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
    options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", prefs);
    ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

 Break until 11:15 EST
 please take extra 5 minutes since we ended later.


Physical server - looks like big computer
Virtual Server (Virtual Machine aka VM) - virtual representation of physical server, that exists within physical server. Since we cannot install more than 1 OS on the server, to share server we can install many VM on top of real physical server.


Version of Selenium Grid that we use is 3.141

6. Selenium Grid Hub and nodes inside containers
5. DOCKER CONTAINER
4. DOCKER
3. AWS EC2 (VM)
2. HOST OS
1. physical server

    Q: Tell me about your selenium grid setup.
    A: My selenium grid consists of 10 (5 - 100) nodes and hub. We are using One AWS EC2 instance with Docker to run Selenium Grid. Mostly, we are doing testing only on the Chrome browser.

    1 container = 1 node = 1 browser = 1 test at the time

    10 nodes = 10 browsers = 10 execution tests at the time


Details: every node is running inside a container along with a browser.

1 node supports execution of 1 test at the time.


    Q: Why you don't use Selenium Grid 4?
    A: Don't break something that is working, but actually there is no stable version yet (as of today). We are avoiding any beta or alpha versions of tools.


### This is stuff is for DEVOPS.

    Q: How to increase number on nodes in Selenium Grid with Docker?

    A: run command on the server that is running grid.

        docker-compose up -d --scale chrome=num

        *where num is desirable number of chrome nodes. By default it's one.
        *where chrome is a service name

    Q: How to start selenium grid with docker?

    A: run command on the server that is running grid:

        docker-compose up -d

    Q: How to STOP selenium grid with docker?

    A: run command on the server that is running grid:

        docker-compose down

    Q: Docker compose ? How it is related to docker?

    A: Docker compose helps to launch group of containers all together. Inside a file (docker-compose.yml) we specify which containers we want to launch.

    Q: How to turn off specific node (with docker containers)

    A: run command on the server that is running grid:
        docker container kill <container id>

    Q: How to see container id and what are the containers currently running?
    A: run command on the server that is running grid:

        docker container ps

        first column is for container id.

### This is stuff is for DEVOPS.

Q: Can I know about this as a tester?
A: Yes, but not required.
